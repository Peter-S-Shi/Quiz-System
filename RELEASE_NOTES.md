# Release Notes

## Pre-release Preparation

Quiz Studio is currently in Feature Complete Review. The v1 candidate feature set has first implementations landed, but full manual QA, Product Hardening, Feature Freeze, Release Candidate validation, and final clean-environment verification are not complete.

This is not a `v1.0.0` release.

## v0.1.0 Stable Preparation

This release prepares Quiz Studio as a local-first static quiz authoring and practice app.

Highlights:

- Bilingual Chinese and English interface.
- Objective question workflows for single choice, multiple choice, blank, true/false, and one-to-one matching.
- Local quiz library, practice history, refresh recovery, wrong-question retry, random selection, and type filters.
- Modular Quiz Core with tests and open JSON Schema.
- PWA files and a manual-only GitHub Pages deployment workflow for future public release.

Known limitations:

- Data is stored in browser local storage, not cloud sync.
- Subjective grading is not included.
- GitHub Pages deployment is deferred while the repository remains private.
